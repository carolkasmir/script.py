# Python List Operations

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various list operations.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following operations on a list:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30` in the list.

## Usage

To run the script, clone the repository and execute the `script.py` file using Python:

```bash
python script.py
